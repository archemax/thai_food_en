Begin by boiling the quail eggs: Place the quail eggs in a saucepan and cover them with water. Bring the water to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook the eggs for about 3-4 minutes. Once done, transfer them to a bowl of ice water to cool. Peel the quail eggs and set them aside. In a mixing bowl, combine the tamarind paste, fish sauce, and palm sugar. Stir until the sugar has dissolved, creating a sweet and tangy tamarind sauce. Adjust the taste with more sugar or fish sauce if needed. Heat vegetable oil in a deep frying pan or wok over medium-high heat. Roll each quail egg in the all-purpose flour, ensuring they are well coated. Carefully place them in the hot oil and fry until they turn golden brown and crispy. Remove the fried quail eggs and place them on paper towels to drain excess oil. In a separate pan, sautÃ© the chopped shallot and Thai bird\'s eye chilies until fragrant. Pour in the tamarind sauce mixture and simmer briefly until it thickens slightly. Arrange the crispy quail eggs on a serving plate, drizzle the tamarind sauce over them, and garnish with chopped cilantro and sliced scallions.

Heat the vegetable oil in a wok or deep pan over medium-high heat. Add the red curry paste and stir-fry for 1-2 minutes until it becomes fragrant. Gradually pour in half of the coconut milk while continuing to stir. Cook for another 2-3 minutes, allowing the paste to dissolve into the coconut milk and thicken slightly. Add the sliced chicken or beef to the pan and cook until it starts to change color and is almost cooked through. Pour in the remaining coconut milk, add kaffir lime leaves, and bring the curry to a gentle simmer. Cook for 5-7 minutes, allowing the meat to become tender. Stir in the fish sauce, palm sugar, and a pinch of salt to balance the flavors. Adjust the seasoning to your taste. Add the eggplant and bell peppers to the curry, simmer for an additional 5 minutes until the vegetables are tender. Toss in the Thai basil leaves and sliced red chilies for an extra burst of flavor and spice. Remove the curry from heat and discard kaffir lime leaves. Serve hot over cooked jasmine rice, garnished with fresh cilantro leaves.

Prepare the Sauce: In a small bowl, mix together the soy sauce, oyster sauce, and sugar. This will be your sauce for the dish.

If using tofu, ensure it\'s lightly browned on all sides. Remove the protein from the pan and set it aside. Cook the Broccoli: In the same pan, add another tablespoon of oil if needed. Add the chopped Chinese broccoli and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until it begins to wilt and turn bright green. Stir in Noodles: Return the cooked noodles to the pan and pour the sauce over them. Toss everything together, ensuring the noodles and broccoli are evenly coated with the sauce. Add Protein: Return the cooked protein to the pan and mix it with the noodles and broccoli. If using, crack an egg into the pan and stir-fry until the egg is cooked and distributed throughout the dish. Final Touches: If desired, add a splash of chicken or vegetable broth to keep the noodles moist and create a bit of sauce. Add crushed red pepper flakes for some heat, if you like.
